# Discord AI Chat Bot

This repository contains the source code for a Discord bot that utilizes the Google Gemini AI to generate responses based on user input. The bot can remember conversation context and handle messages that exceed Discord's character limit by splitting them into multiple parts.

## Features

- **AI-Generated Responses:** Uses Google's Gemini AI to generate context-aware responses.
- **Context Management:** Remembers conversation context to provide coherent follow-up responses.
- **Character Limit Handling:** Automatically splits long responses to fit Discord's message length limit.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A Discord Bot Token ([How to create a Discord bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html))
- A Google API Key with access to Gemini AI

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-ai-chat-bot.git
   cd discord-ai-chat-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your `.env` file**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Discord Bot Token and Google API Key:

   ```
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the bot**

   ```
   python3 bot.py
   ```

## Deploying with Docker

To deploy this bot in a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dockerfile**

   Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project with the following content:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.8-slim

   # Set the working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the current directory contents into the container
   COPY . /app

   # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Run bot.py when the container launches
   CMD ["python3", "bot.py"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**

   Run the following command in the same directory as your Dockerfile:

   ```
   docker build -t discord-ai-chat-bot .
   ```

3. **Run the bot inside a Docker container**

   ```
   docker run -d discord-ai-chat-bot
   ```

Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your machine. This command builds the Docker image and runs it in a container, starting your bot.
